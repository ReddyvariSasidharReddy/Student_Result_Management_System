# Actors Identification

Actors represent the users or external entities that interact with the Student Result Management System. Identifying actors helps in understanding system usage and defining interactions clearly during system design.

The primary actor of the system is the Student, who accesses the system to view academic results, grades, and backlog information. Students interact with the system mainly for result viewing and performance evaluation.

The Faculty is another important actor responsible for entering, updating, and verifying student marks. Faculty members interact with the system to manage academic records accurately.

The Administrator acts as a high-privilege actor who manages system operations. This actor is responsible for user management, role assignment, access control, and system security.

Additionally, College Management can be considered a secondary actor who uses result reports and performance analysis for academic decision-making.

Identifying these actors helps define system boundaries and serves as the foundation for creating use case diagrams and further design artifacts.
