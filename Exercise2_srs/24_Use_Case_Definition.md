# Use Case Definition

Use cases define the interactions between actors and the Student Result Management System to achieve specific goals. They describe the functional behavior of the system from the user’s perspective and help in understanding system requirements clearly.

The core use cases of the system include User Login, Result Entry, Result Calculation, Result Viewing, Backlog Identification, User Management, and Report Generation. Each use case represents a specific function performed by the system in response to an action initiated by an actor.

Students use the Result Viewing and Backlog Checking use cases to access their academic performance details. Faculty members interact with the system through Result Entry and Result Update use cases to manage student marks. Administrators use User Management and System Maintenance use cases to control system operations and ensure security.

Defining use cases helps identify system functionality, clarify user requirements, and provide a foundation for creating detailed use case diagrams and sequence diagrams.
