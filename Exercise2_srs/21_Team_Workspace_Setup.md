# Team Workspace Setup

The team workspace setup is an important step in ensuring effective collaboration among team members during the development of the Student Result Management System. A shared workspace allows all team members to work together, access project files, and maintain consistency in system design and documentation.

For this project, a common workspace was created using the selected CASE tool. The workspace includes a centralized project repository where all design diagrams and related documents are stored. Each team member was provided access to the workspace to view, edit, and update diagrams as per their assigned responsibilities.

Clear folder structures and naming conventions were followed to organize use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other design artifacts. Version control practices were followed to avoid conflicts and ensure that changes made by team members are properly tracked.

Regular coordination among team members was maintained to review updates in the workspace and ensure alignment with project requirements. The team workspace setup improved collaboration, reduced redundancy, and supported smooth progress throughout the design phase of the Student Result Management System.
