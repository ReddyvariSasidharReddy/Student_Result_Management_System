# Project Structure Creation

Project structure creation involves organizing the system components and design artifacts in a systematic manner to ensure clarity and ease of understanding. For the Student Result Management System, a well-defined project structure was created using the selected CASE tool.

The project structure includes separate sections for requirement documents, UML diagrams, and supporting design artifacts. Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams are organized into appropriate folders within the project workspace. This structured organization helps team members easily locate and manage design elements.

Standard naming conventions were followed for all diagrams and files to maintain consistency. The project structure supports modular design, making it easier to update or modify specific components without affecting the overall system. Creating a clear project structure ensures better documentation management and smooth progression through the system design phase.
