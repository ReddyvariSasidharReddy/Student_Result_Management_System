# Class Identification 

Class identification is the process of identifying the key classes required to model the Student Result Management System. Classes represent real-world entities and system components that store data and perform operations. Identifying classes helps in designing the class diagram and defining system structure.

The Student class represents students enrolled in the institution and stores details such as student ID, name, department, semester, and result information. The Faculty class represents teaching staff responsible for entering and verifying student marks. The Administrator class manages system users, roles, and security settings.

The Result class stores academic performance data including marks, grades, pass or fail status, and backlog details. The Subject class represents individual subjects with attributes such as subject code, subject name, and credits. The User class acts as a general class for authentication and authorization, which can be specialized into Student, Faculty, and Administrator.

Identifying these classes helps define system responsibilities, relationships, and interactions, and forms the foundation for creating class diagrams in the design phase.
