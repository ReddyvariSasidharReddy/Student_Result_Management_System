# Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams are used to represent the interaction between objects in the Student Result Management System in a sequential order over time. These diagrams help in understanding how different system components communicate with each other to perform a specific function.

In the User Login sequence diagram, the user enters login credentials, which are sent to the system for authentication. The system verifies the credentials using the database and grants access if the details are valid. This sequence clearly shows the interaction between the User, Authentication Module, and Database.

The Result Entry sequence diagram illustrates how faculty members enter student marks. The faculty submits marks to the system, which stores the data in the database after validation. This sequence ensures accurate and secure storage of academic records.

The Result Viewing sequence diagram shows how students request their results. The system retrieves the required data from the database and displays the results along with grades and backlog information. These sequence diagrams provide a clear understanding of system behavior and support detailed system design.
