# Design Document

The design document describes the overall system design and architecture of the Student Result Management System. It explains how system requirements are translated into a structured design using UML diagrams and standard software engineering principles. This document serves as a blueprint for system implementation and future enhancements.

The system is designed using a modular architecture to ensure clarity, maintainability, and scalability. The major modules include User Management, Authentication, Result Management, Backlog Management, Performance Analysis, and Database Management. Each module has a clearly defined responsibility and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

UML diagrams such as use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams are used to represent different aspects of the system. Use case diagrams describe user interactions, class diagrams define system structure, sequence diagrams show object interactions, and activity diagrams illustrate workflows. Component and deployment diagrams provide an overview of system architecture and physical deployment.

The system follows role-based access control to ensure security. Students can view results and backlog details, faculty members can enter and update marks, and administrators manage users and system configuration. Data is stored in a centralized database to ensure consistency and easy retrieval.

The design focuses on usability, reliability, and security. Proper validation mechanisms are included to prevent incorrect data entry, and secure authentication ensures authorized access. This design document ensures that the Student Result Management System meets academic requirements and provides a strong foundation for implementation and future improvements.
