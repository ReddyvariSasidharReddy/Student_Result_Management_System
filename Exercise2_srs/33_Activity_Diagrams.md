# Activity Diagrams

Activity diagrams are used to represent the workflow of activities in the Student Result Management System. They show the sequence of actions, decision points, and parallel activities involved in completing a particular process. These diagrams help in understanding the dynamic behavior of the system.

In the User Login activity diagram, the workflow begins when a user enters login credentials. The system validates the credentials and, based on the result, either grants access to the dashboard or displays an error message. This diagram clearly represents decision-making and alternate paths.

The Result Management activity diagram illustrates the process followed by faculty members to enter and update student marks. The workflow includes selecting a subject, entering marks, validating data, and saving results to the database. Decision points are included to handle invalid data entries.

The Result Viewing activity diagram shows how students access their results. The process starts with selecting the semester, followed by result retrieval and display. If results are not available, an appropriate message is shown. These activity diagrams provide a clear understanding of system workflows and support effective system design.
