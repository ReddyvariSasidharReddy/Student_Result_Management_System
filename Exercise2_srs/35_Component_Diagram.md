# Component Diagram

A component diagram represents the high-level architecture of the Student Result Management System by showing how different software components interact with each other. It helps in understanding the system’s structure and the relationships between its major modules.

The system consists of several key components, including the User Interface Component, Authentication Component, Result Management Component, Backlog Management Component, and Database Component. The User Interface component allows students, faculty, and administrators to interact with the system through login, result entry, and result viewing screens.

The Authentication component handles user login, validation, and access control. The Result Management component is responsible for storing, updating, and retrieving student marks and grades. The Backlog Management component identifies students with backlogs and maintains backlog records. All components interact with the Database component to store and retrieve academic data securely.

The component diagram provides a clear overview of system organization, supports modular design, and helps in understanding how system components work together to deliver required functionality.
