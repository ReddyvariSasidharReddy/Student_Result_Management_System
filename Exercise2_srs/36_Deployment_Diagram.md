# Deployment Diagram

A deployment diagram represents the physical deployment of the Student Result Management System by showing how software components are distributed across hardware nodes. It helps in understanding the system’s runtime environment and how different components communicate with each other.

In this system, the Client Node represents user devices such as computers or laptops used by students, faculty, and administrators. These users access the system through a web browser. The Application Server hosts the core application logic, including authentication, result management, backlog analysis, and report generation modules.

The Database Server stores all academic data such as student details, marks, grades, and backlog information. The application server communicates with the database server to store and retrieve data securely. Proper security mechanisms are implemented to protect data during communication between servers.

The deployment diagram provides a clear view of system infrastructure, ensuring that the Student Result Management System is scalable, secure, and efficiently deployed in a real-world environment.
