# Workflow Documentation

Workflow documentation describes the step-by-step process followed within the Student Result Management System to perform key operations. It explains how activities flow from one step to another, including decision points and responsibilities of different users.

The workflow begins with user authentication, where students, faculty, and administrators log into the system using valid credentials. Once authenticated, users are directed to their respective dashboards based on their roles.

For result entry, faculty members select the appropriate subject and student, enter marks, and submit the data. The system validates the entered information and stores it securely in the database. If invalid data is detected, the workflow redirects the user to correct the input.

In the result viewing workflow, students select the semester and request their results. The system retrieves the relevant data from the database and displays results along with grades and backlog information. If results are not yet published, a notification is shown.

Administrative workflows include managing users, assigning roles, and maintaining system security. Overall, the documented workflows ensure clarity, reduce errors, and support smooth operation of the Student Result Management System.
