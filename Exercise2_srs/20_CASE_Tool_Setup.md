# CASE Tool Setup

CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools play an important role in the software development process by supporting system analysis, design, and documentation activities. For the Student Result Management System, a suitable CASE tool such as StarUML or Visual Paradigm has been selected to model the system using standard UML diagrams.

The CASE tool was successfully installed and configured on the development system. During the setup process, the required software environment was verified to ensure compatibility with the tool. A new project workspace was created specifically for the Student Result Management System, and appropriate project settings were configured to support UML-based modeling.

The tool setup includes enabling commonly used diagram types such as Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, Component Diagrams, and Deployment Diagrams. Standard UML notations and symbols were selected to maintain consistency and clarity across all design documents. The tool also allows easy organization and navigation of diagrams within the project workspace.

Using a CASE tool helps in visually representing the system structure and behavior, making it easier for developers and stakeholders to understand system design. It supports better communication among team members and allows quick updates when design changes are required. Proper CASE tool setup ensures accurate system modeling and provides a strong foundation for the detailed design phase of the Student Result Management System.
