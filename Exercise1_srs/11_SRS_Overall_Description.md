# Overall Description

The Student Result Management System is a web-based application designed to manage and maintain student academic result records in a centralized and efficient manner. The system replaces traditional manual methods with an automated solution that improves accuracy, reduces processing time, and enhances data accessibility.

The system provides different user roles such as students, faculty, and administrators. Students can securely log in to view their results, grades, and backlog information. Faculty members can enter, update, and verify student marks, while administrators manage users, control access, and ensure data security.

The system is designed to operate in a standard web environment and can be accessed using a web browser. It ensures data consistency and reliability by storing academic records in a centralized database. Basic performance analysis and graphical representation of past and current results are supported to help monitor academic progress.

The Student Result Management System is intended to be user-friendly, secure, and scalable. It is designed to meet academic requirements and can be enhanced in the future to include additional features such as advanced analytics, notifications, and mobile support.
