# Introduction

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a detailed description of the requirements for the Student Result Management System. The purpose of this document is to clearly define the system’s functionalities, constraints, and performance expectations so that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the project.

The Student Result Management System is developed to overcome the limitations of traditional manual result management processes. Manual systems are often time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. This system aims to automate result processing, improve accuracy, and ensure quick access to academic records for students, faculty, and administrators.

The system supports secure user access, efficient result entry, backlog identification, and basic performance analysis using graphical representations. It also helps institutions monitor student performance trends over time and take necessary academic actions.

This SRS document serves as a reference for system developers, project team members, faculty, administrators, and instructors. It provides the foundation for system design, implementation, testing, and future enhancements of the Student Result Management System.
