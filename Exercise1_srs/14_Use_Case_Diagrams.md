# Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are used to represent the functional requirements of the Student Result Management System and illustrate the interactions between users (actors) and the system. These diagrams help in understanding how different users interact with the system and what services the system provides.

In this system, the main actors are Student, Faculty, and Administrator. Each actor interacts with the system based on their roles and permissions.

The Student actor can log in to the system, view examination results, check grades, and identify backlog subjects. The Faculty actor can log in, enter student marks, update results, and verify academic records. The Administrator actor manages user accounts, controls access permissions, and maintains system security.

Use case diagrams provide a high-level view of system functionality and help stakeholders clearly understand system behavior. They also serve as a foundation for further design activities such as sequence diagrams and class diagrams.
