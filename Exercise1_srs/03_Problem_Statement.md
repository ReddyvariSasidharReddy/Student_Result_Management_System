# Problem Statement

In many educational institutions, student result management is still handled through manual or basic computerized systems, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage efficiently. These systems mainly focus on storing and displaying marks, offering little or no insight into student performance. As a result, students do not receive proper academic guidance, and faculty face challenges in tracking progress and identifying weak areas.

The lack of graphical analysis makes it difficult to understand performance trends, while inadequate automation and security increase the risk of data inconsistency and unauthorized access. To overcome these issues, there is a need for an intelligent student result management system that not only automates result processing but also provides performance analysis through graphs and offers guidance to help students improve their academic performance.
