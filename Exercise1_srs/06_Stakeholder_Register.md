# Stakeholder Register

A stakeholder register is a document that identifies all key stakeholders involved in the Student Result Management System along with their roles and level of interest. It helps the project team understand stakeholder involvement and manage communication effectively.

The primary stakeholder is the student, who uses the system to view results and backlog information and has high interest. Faculty members are responsible for entering and verifying marks and have moderate influence on system functionality. The system administrator manages users and system security and has high influence and responsibility. College management uses result reports for academic decision-making and planning.

The project development team handles system design and documentation, while the instructor provides guidance and ensures academic standards are met. Maintaining a stakeholder register supports smooth project execution and coordination.
