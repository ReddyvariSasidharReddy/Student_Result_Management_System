# Scope Boundaries

The scope boundaries of the Student Result Management System clearly define what is included and excluded in the project to avoid ambiguity and scope creep. The system focuses only on managing, analyzing, and displaying student academic results in an efficient manner.

The project includes result entry, result viewing, backlog identification, basic performance analysis, and graphical representation of past and current results. User management and data security are also within the project boundaries.

The system does not include examination conduction, attendance management, fee management, or timetable scheduling. Integration with external systems, mobile applications, and advanced analytics is beyond the defined scope.

These boundaries ensure that the project remains focused on its core objectives and is completed within the given academic requirements.
