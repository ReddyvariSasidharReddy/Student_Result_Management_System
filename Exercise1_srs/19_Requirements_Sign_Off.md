# Requirements Sign-Off

The requirements sign-off marks the formal approval of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Student Result Management System. This document confirms that all system requirements have been reviewed, discussed, and agreed upon by the relevant stakeholders. It ensures that the requirements accurately reflect the objectives and expectations of the project.

The SRS document includes detailed descriptions of the system scope, overall functionality, stakeholder requirements, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements. These requirements have been validated to ensure completeness, clarity, and feasibility. Special attention has been given to critical aspects such as result management, backlog identification, system security, usability, and performance.

By approving this sign-off, stakeholders acknowledge that the documented requirements provide a stable and reliable foundation for system design, development, and testing. Any future modifications to the requirements will follow a formal change management process to avoid misunderstandings or scope creep.

This requirements sign-off represents a mutual agreement between the project team and stakeholders and signifies readiness to proceed to the next phase of the project. It ensures accountability, reduces project risks, and supports successful implementation of the Student Result Management System.
