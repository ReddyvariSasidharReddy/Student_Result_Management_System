# Complete SRS Document

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for the Student Result Management System has been prepared to provide a comprehensive description of the system requirements. The document brings together all essential components required for understanding and developing the system in an organized manner.

The SRS includes the introduction, overall system description, scope definition, stakeholder analysis, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements. It clearly explains how the system will manage student results, identify backlogs, and support performance analysis through graphical representations. The document also defines user roles such as students, faculty, and administrators along with their interactions with the system.

Non-functional requirements such as security, usability, performance, and reliability are specified to ensure that the system operates efficiently and securely. Use case diagrams and related explanations are included to provide a clear understanding of system behavior.

This complete SRS document acts as a reference for developers, project team members, and instructors during system design, implementation, and evaluation. It ensures consistency, clarity, and alignment with academic and project objectives.
