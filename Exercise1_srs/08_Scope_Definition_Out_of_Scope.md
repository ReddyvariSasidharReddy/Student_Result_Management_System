# Out-of-Scope

The out-of-scope of the Student Result Management System defines the features and activities that are not included in the current phase of the project. These limitations help in maintaining clear project boundaries and avoiding scope creep.

The system does not include examination conduction, question paper generation, or online test functionality. It does not handle attendance management, fee management, or timetable scheduling. Advanced analytics such as predictive modeling using artificial intelligence or machine learning are not included in this version of the system.

The project does not support integration with external university systems, learning management systems, or mobile applications in the current scope. Real-time notifications through SMS or email and multi-language support are also excluded. Hardware maintenance, server infrastructure management, and external database integration are beyond the scope of this project.
