# Stakeholder Register Submission

The stakeholder register for the Student Result Management System has been prepared to identify all key stakeholders involved in the project along with their roles, interests, and influence. This document ensures clarity in stakeholder involvement and supports effective communication throughout the project lifecycle.

The stakeholder register includes primary stakeholders such as students, faculty members, system administrators, and college management. It also includes the project development team and the instructor, who play important roles in system development and academic evaluation.

The completed stakeholder register has been reviewed and submitted as part of the project documentation. It serves as a reference for understanding stakeholder expectations and ensuring that project objectives align with stakeholder needs.
