# Scope

The scope of the Student Result Management System includes all functionalities related to managing, analyzing, and improving student academic performance. The system provides a centralized platform for storing and processing student results in a secure and efficient manner.

The system includes analysis of past academic results, which helps in understanding student performance trends over previous semesters. Using this data, graphical representations such as bar graphs or line graphs can be generated to show improvement or decline in pass percentages, subject-wise performance, and overall academic growth. This analysis helps faculty and management identify areas that require academic attention.

Another important feature within scope is tracking students having backlogs. The system maintains records of students who had backlogs in previous semesters and compares them with the current semester data. This comparison helps in identifying whether the number of backlogs has reduced or increased, thereby measuring the effectiveness of academic improvements and interventions.

Based on result analysis, the system also supports providing suggestions for improvement. These suggestions may include conducting remedial classes, offering academic counseling, improving teaching methods, and providing additional learning resources for weak subjects. This helps students improve their performance and reduce backlogs over time.

Overall, the in-scope features aim to improve result accuracy, enable performance analysis through graphs, monitor backlog trends, and support data-driven academic improvements.
